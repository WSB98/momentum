# Momentum

Momentum is a JavaScript-based game with two goals:
- Be a web-game that works on all devices
- Take inspiration from rogue-like games and create an infinte dungeon crawler arcade game

# What is the game?
If ou were to fork the game as is, it is in rough shape. its 300 lines of JS that give you very basic controls, collision, and primative enemy AI.
The eventual goal is for the game to be very based in movement, and how well the player can keep their pace. With various power ups, enemies, and weapons throghout
the randomly generated rooms, the player will make their way through these dungeons earning points and using a weapon that is temporarily modified with power ups throughout the game.
The name, ***Momentum***, applies to how points are calculated, and how much damage the player does. In short, ```Momemntum++ = damage+ && pomts+``` and vice versa.
